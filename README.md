Class 6 question's answers
  1.Why is a base case needed in recursion?
    ans==A base case in recursion is needed to stop the function from calling itself forever.
          Think of it like a finish line: it tells the function when to stop running.

2.What are the main differences between map(), filter(), and reduce()?
  ans==map() transforms items,
        filter() selects items,
        reduce() combines items into one.

3.How do *args and **kwargs help in making flexible functions?
  ans==(I do not also understand the answer i am about to give)
         *args: Lets you pass any number of positional arguments to a function.
      **kwargs: Lets you pass any number of keyword arguments (named arguments).
